Backend: Flask, Python
## The algorithms/AI schemes used in the core engine
The solution to the classic knapsack problem can be solved with dynamic programming, which gives an optimized set of items to place in the knapsack/backpack. In each level of the game, the player must navigate and find items and place them in their bag to reach a certain value, which should be less than or equal to the optimal solution from the knapsack problem.
## Market Space
This application can educate the user on the knapsack problem while providing a fun and interactive experience. It's simplicity can appeal to a wide audience of children and casual users, while more experienced users may test their speed and shoot for a higher score.
